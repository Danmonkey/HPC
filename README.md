# HPC
A collection of homeworks/programs done for my High-Performance Computing independent study with Dr. Asai Asaithambi.


#Program 1: Gauss-Jacobi Method
The first program in the collection implements the Gauss-Jacobi iterative method for solving linear systems of equations as a matrix.
The Matrix class is implemented as a flattened (I.E. a one-dimensional) array.
